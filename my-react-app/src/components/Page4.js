      Ok, here’s where things get interesting. We’ve told this story a thousand times and will probably keep telling it, so let’s take it from the top. After another one of those nights in Gardenia, we were walking back together, talking about something I don’t remember when we finally got back to Dykstra. I wanted to see you again, but I still felt more comfortable in the group, so I asked if you wanted to get dinner the next day (as in with everybody). Only I had completely forgotten my genius move a few days before of telling you about the last time I asked out a girl. In which I used the same line. I didn’t think too much of it, but I got a surprise call at midnight. It was you. You said you wanted to talk to me, so I got out of bed and opened the door to find you already standing in front of me. After a pause, you said, “When you said dinner, did you mean just us? Because I wouldn’t mind that”. My mind thought of everything and nothing at once. It was everything I wanted and everything I feared all in one. I can make excuses for what I said next, but the truth was that I was scared. My first attempt at a relationship took years to develop, but this was different. After only a couple of weeks, I really liked you, but I needed to make sure I was ready, that it wasn’t just something spur of the moment. I’d never had someone be so direct and honest with me, and after high school, I wasn’t sure if anyone would really look at me and like me the way you did. It was exciting but also uncharted waters. Of course, I didn’t relay any of this to you and instead replied with, “I…uhhhh…meant dinner with the group, but…uhh…uhmm…I would maybe possibly want that later.” Contrary to popular belief, I didn’t slam the door in your face, but I did call Akrit and have a 2-hour walk to dwell on how stupid I was. Looking back, I should’ve just said yes, but with the way things worked out, I wouldn’t have it any other way.
